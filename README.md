# Interpol

#### INTERPOL, which stands for Integer Program Oriented Language, is a language specifically designed for IS 214 students. It is integer-oriented as it primarily deals with integers and floating-point values are not allowed. This implies that the results of arithmetic operations are automatically converted to integers. Strings are also allowed for printing purposes.

## Interface and Flow
- The user writes his INTERPOL source code using any text editor. Take note that the source code has ".ipol" extension.
- From the command prompt, the user runs your interpreter. Your interpreterthen asks for the file name of the .ipol code to be executed.
- Still in the command prompt, the following outputs are displayed to the user.
    - Actual output of the source code
        - If there's an error, the user should be informed of the error and possibly, the source of the error.
    - Symbol table
    - Lexemes and tokens table

## To run the program
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emasuncion1/Interpol.git
cd Interpol
pip install # this will install the packages
python3 em-asuncion-03.py # run the code
```
- There are sample files in the directory in which you can use to run the code an check the program.
